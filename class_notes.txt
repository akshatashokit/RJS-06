==========
Note : both Framework and library containes predefined functionalities.

we should follow Rules & Regulations to use Framework

No Need to Follow Rules and Regulations to Use Library



Differnces Between Angular and ReactJS
======================================


		Angular						ReactJS


1) Initial Version of Angular Released			intial version Released in 2013.
   in 2010.

   Current Version is Angular11				current version is "17.x"



2) Angular Released by Google				ReactJS Released by Facebook.


3) Official Documentaion Available			Official Documentation Available
   with "angular.io"					with "react.org"


4) Angular is the Framework				React is the library



5) Angular Follows The Real DOM				React Follows The Virtual DOM


6) Angular Applications having less performance		React Applications are 10x faster
   Compared to React.					compared to Angular Applications.



7) HttpClient used to make the Rest API			no predefined support to make Rest
   calls						API calls

							need to depende on 3rd party libraries

							"axios"


8) RouterModule is the inbuild in Angular,		by default React won't supports
   used to implement the Single Page Applications	Single Page Applications

							"react-router-dom" library


9) Angular Provides the Validations Support		React won't Provides the Validations Support.



10) NgRX						Redux

							Saga

							Thunk




11) Angular follows the Two way				React follows the one way data binding
    Data Binding





NodeJS
======

	- NodeJS is the Running Environment to Execute JavaScript Based Servers.

	- By using NodeJS, we can build the Servers.

		Http Server

		TCP Server

	- we will build the Servers by using "JavaScript".

	- NodeJS is the Backend Technology.


	- NodeJS plays major Role to build MEAN Stack, MERN Stack and MEVN Stack Applications


	M	-      MongoDB

	E       -      ExpressJS

	A	-      Angular11		R	-       ReactJS		V - VueJS

	N 	- 	NodeJS

Environmental Setup
====================

1) download and install NodeJS

    - "npm", "node" and "npx" are the tools present in NodeJS.  

    - "npm" stands for Node Packaging Manager.

    - "npx" stands for nod pckaging runner.

    - "npm" helps to install the React Software.

    - "npx" helps to create the React "Projects".

website : https://nodejs.org/en/download/

file    : node-v14.16.1-x64.msi


2) install yarn tool.


    yarn is the tool, provided by facebook.

    yarn tool, used to download the 3rd party libraries.

    Ex.
        axios

        react-router-dom

        redux

        saga

        thunk

        ---
        ---
        ---

    - we will install yarn tool by using following command.

   > npm install -g yarn

    "-g" stands for global installation.



3) install create-react-app


    - create-react-app is the tool provided by facebook.

    - create-react-app used to create the react applications.

    - we will install create-react-app tool, by using following command.

    > npm install -g create-react-app


4) install Visual Studio Code


    - Visual Studio Code is the IDE, provided by microsoft.

    - Visual Studio Code also called as VSCode.

    - VSCode is the open source IDE.

    - VSCode ide used to build the Angular,React,Vue,NodeJS,........

website : https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win

file    : VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.55.0.exe


                                creating the react application

1) create the react application with the following command.


    > npx create-react-app first-app --template typescript

        - where "first-app" is the name of the react application.


2) switch to react application

    > cd first-app

3) execute the react application

    > yarn start

    by default react application running on port no.3000

Directory Structure


1) node_modules

        - node_modules containes predefined libraries.

        - these libraries helps to execute the react application.

2) public / favicon.ico

        - This is default logo of ReactJS.

3) public / index.html

       - index.html file is the main template.

        - react starts the execution from "index.html" file.

        - main template containes "div" as main DOM Element whose id is "root"

        Ex.
                <div id="root"></div>





4) public/logo192.png
          logo512.png


        - PWA Stands for Progressive Web Apps.

        - Execution of web applications with minimum content without network.

        - above logos helps to implement the PWA in React Envirinment.


5) public/manifest.json

        - it is used to configure the mobile applications development.


6) public/robots.txt

      - it is used to write the rules and regulations.


7) src

     - used to deploy the components.


8) src / App.tsx
         App.css
         App.test.tsx

        - when ever we create the Project automatically "App" Component is the Default Component.

        - "App.css" file representing style sheet.

        - "App.test.tsx" file representing the test cases file.

9) src / index.tsx

    - This file acting as Registration file.

    - After Deployment of our components, we should register in index.tsx file.


10) src / index.css

    - used to define the global styles to Reacy Applications.


11) src/logo.svg

    - This is the default svg logo of ReactJS.






                            ***** Component ******

    - simple "typescript" class behaves like "component".

    - components simplifies the "complex" UI.

    - these components are "reusable".

    - we will save the typescript files with ".ts" or ".tsx" extension.

    - we will deploy components in "src" folder.

    - all the components we need to register in "index.tsx" file.

    - "index.tsx" file is the "registration" file.

    - state object, used to represent the "component" data.

    - in general, we will declare state by using interfaces.

                                        =========

    - axios is the 3rd party library, used to make the rest api calls.

    - we will download axios module, by using yarn tool.

    > yarn add axios --save

step 1.
    create the react application

    > npx create-react-app rest-api --template typescript


step 2.
    switch to project

    > cd rest-api

step 3.
    download axios module

    > yarn add axios --save


step 4.
    create the component.

    GetEx.tsx

state
=====
    - component data, technically called as state.

    - state is the predefined "object" in "reactjs".

                                            ****** single page applications ******

        - loading "one component" to "another component" without "refreshing" the whole webpage called as "single page application".

        - "navigation" of one component to anorher component in single page applications called as "Routing".

        - "react-router-dom" is the library used to implement the single page applications.

        - we will download "react-router-dom" module by using "yarn" tool.

        > yarn add react-router-dom --save


steps to implement the single page applications
===============================================
1) create the react application

                   > npx create-react-app spa-app --template typescript


2) switch to react application

                  > cd spa-app


3) download the react-router-dom module

                > yarn add react-router-dom @types/react-router-dom --save

4) create the child components

**********************************************************
spa-app
      src
        screens
            HomeScreen.tsx

            ProductScreen.tsx

            CartScreen.tsx
**********************************************************


step 5.
    create the App Component.


            "App" Component behaves like "Parent Component" in "Single Page Applications".

    create the App Component







                                    State Management Ex
                                    -------------------

1) create the Directory

Ex.
    reduxEx

2) switch to reduxEx

    > cd reduxEx

3) download the redux library

    > yarn add redux --save

4) create the state menagement application

    Ex.
        Bank.js

1) create the directory

    Ex.
            reduxEx1

2) switch to reduxEx1

                > yarn add redux --save

        => npm tool

                > npm install redux --save

        => package.json file

        {
            "name":"AshokIT",
            "version":1.0.0,
